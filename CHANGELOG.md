# Changelog

All notable changes to Voxint. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (0.x — expect breaking changes between minors).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-12

First public release.

### Added
- End-to-end pipeline: preprocess → transcribe (faster-whisper) + diarize
  (pyannote) + embed (TitaNet) → optional LLM transcript enhancement →
  speaker matching → human adjudication.
- Compare-and-swap run/stage state machine in Postgres with leased stage
  claims, retry budgets, and a beat-scheduled crash-recovery sweep.
- Adjudication web console (review queue, guarded slot workbench,
  decision-resolved transcript export) served as Jinja + htmx from the API.
- pgvector cosine speaker matching with a strict *named ≠ grounded* invariant;
  machine proposals kept separate from human rulings (append-only ledger).
- Scoring harness `voxint score` (name-accuracy, acoustic agreement, ensemble
  fusion) — DB-free, installable standalone from PyPI; synthetic walkthrough
  under `examples/`.
- Three GPU model services with frozen v1 HTTP contracts
  (`/v1/transcribe`, `/v1/diarize`, `/v1/embed`).
- Compose-first deployment: pinned GHCR release images by default,
  build-from-source overlays (`compose.build.yaml`, `compose.gpu.build.yaml`),
  one-shot `migrate` gate, swappable domain pack.
