"""Shared FastAPI dependencies for the Console 2.0 routers (issue #151).

Injection, auth, onboarding-gate, and CSRF-verification seams every router area
reuses, extracted from ``voxint.api.app`` in the P0b router decomposition so
router modules import them here rather than from the app module (importing from
``app`` would be a cycle, since ``app`` imports the routers). ``app`` re-exports
these same objects, so existing imports and the object-identity checks in the
Console 2.0 characterization contract keep resolving to the definitions here.

    Wired as a single router-level dependency on the *protected* router that

    stay on ``app`` and so are structurally exempt — no path matching to keep in
    sync). It depends on ``OperatorDep`` so authentication runs first: an
    unauthenticated request gets a 401 challenge, never a redirect that would leak
    onboarding state. It depends on ``SessionDep`` so FastAPI's per-request
    dependency cache hands the gate the same ``Session`` the route handler uses —
    one connection, not two.

    The onboarding read is cached on ``request.state`` for the life of the request
    only. It is deliberately NOT cached on ``app.state``: the Celery worker can
    flip ``onboarding_complete`` in its own process, so a cross-request cache would
    serve a stale answer. Not onboarded ⇒ ``303`` to ``/setup`` for an ordinary
    navigation, or a ``204`` carrying ``HX-Redirect`` for an htmx request (htmx
    performs the client-side redirect; a 303's body would be swapped into the page
