"""FastAPI application: the review console (queue, workbench, media), health.

Adjudication is post-hoc: only COMPLETED runs appear in the queue, and nothing
here touches the pipeline state machine. Every route except ``/healthz`` sits
behind single-operator basic auth; mutations additionally require the live
claim token, and each rendered form carries a fresh server-issued nonce that
becomes the ledger idempotency key — an htmx retry of the same form is a
harmless replay, while a new submission is a new decision (corrections are
appends; the newest ruling per label wins at read time).

    by the time the handler executes, the whole body is already spooled. This
    ASGI middleware inspects only the ``Content-Length`` header and returns 413
    before Starlette consumes the body, so an *honestly-declared* oversized upload
    is rejected early ("reject oversized Content-Length early" is real). The
    authoritative per-file cap is still enforced while streaming in
    ``submit_upload``.

    Residual (NOT covered here): a chunked request with no ``Content-Length``, or
    a transport that permits an understated one, is still fully multipart-spooled
    by Starlette before the streaming cap runs — so pre-body spooling is bounded
    only for honest declared lengths, not universally. A truly-bounded streaming
    multipart parse (and moving Basic auth ahead of body parsing, which a per-route
    ``OperatorDep`` cannot, given FastAPI's dispatch order) is deferred to the
